## Technical Debugging

### Check Application Status
```bash
python scripts/check_app_status.py
```

### Check Database
```bash
python scripts/check_db.py
```

### Reset Database (if needed)
```bash
python scripts/setup_sqlite_db.py
```

### Check Application Logs
Look for error messages in the terminal where you ran `python app.py`

## Browser Console Debugging

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try to login and look for any error messages
4. Common errors to look for:
   - JavaScript errors
   - Network errors (404, 500, etc.)
   - CORS errors

## Network Issues

### Check if application is running
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000
```

### Check specific endpoints
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/login
curl http://localhost:5000/register
```

## Session Issues

If you're getting logged out immediately or sessions aren't persisting:

1. Check that the secret key is set properly
2. Clear browser cookies and try again
3. Try a different browser
4. Check if you have multiple tabs open with different sessions

## Still Having Issues?

If none of the above solutions work:

1. **Check the application logs** in the terminal where you ran `python app.py`
2. **Try the test script**: `python test_login_functionality.py`
3. **Reset the database**: `python scripts/setup_sqlite_db.py`
4. **Restart the application**: Stop the current process and run `python app.py` again
